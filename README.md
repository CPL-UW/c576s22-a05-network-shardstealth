# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

Apologies for the mess. YMMV.

For testing, run both build1 and build2. In one screen hit host then drop a piece. In the other screen then hit client.

There is now a counter at the top that counts how many pieces the opponent has dropped.
